## About

Hi! I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Yale University, fortunate to work with [Manolis Zampetakis](https://mzampet.com) and [Andre Wibisono](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/wibisono/). Prior to starting my Ph.D. studies, I worked at Twitter in the Ads Targeting and Modeling team as a machine learning engineer. Before that, I completed my master's and bachelor's degrees together at the University of Pennsylvania, where I was advised by [Shivani Agarwal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q4ErnU4AAAAJ&hl=en) for my master's thesis.

I received a [GFSD](https://stemfellowships.org) (formerly NPSC) fellowship in 2022, sponsored by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). 


## Research

I am interested in machine learning theory and optimization, particularly when theoretical insights can improve the design and practical use of machine learning algorithms.

## Service and Outreach
I believe that being able to give back to others is a privilege. I have received much help to get to where I am today, and I am glad to be able to help others now. I enjoy volunteering with organizations that help students with meeting their educational needs because I feel that education is one way to empower young people to take control of their futures.

(External) Volunteering:
- [Microsoft TEALS Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals), Volunteer Teaching Assistant (2021-2024)
- [The SMART Program](https://thesmartprogram.org), Volunteer Tutor (2019-2021)

(For those who are interested in getting involved, I highly recommend volunteering with the above organizations. I've had a great time working with the staff who are very organized and the students who are eager to learn. The SMART program is local to the the San Francisco Bay Area, but the TEALS program works with high schools throughout the country.)

## Miscellaneous
- My [sister](https://renaalee.github.io) is also a (really accomplished!) PhD student, in astronomy. Check out her page!
- I have been playing [Puzzle and Dragons](https://www.puzzleanddragons.us) (on and off) since high school. I also like to play Pokemon Go and Don't Starve Together and lately Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel and Hearthstone, so if you are at Yale let me know if you'd like to be friends on any of these games.
- I also enjoy cooking, painting, and fashion.
